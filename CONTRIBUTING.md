# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving Paginatify! There are many ways you can contribute, depending on how hands-on you wish to be.

## Open an issue

If you find a bug or want to request a feature, just [open an issue](https://github.com/briansokol/react-paginatify/issues/new). Try to be as thorough as possible when describing the change request.

Whether it's a feature request or a bug, there will likely be a brief conversation just so I can determine exactly what outcome you're looking for. If it's something that I don't think should be a part of Paginatify, I'll explain why. No matter what, I think an open dialogue about issues and features is very important.

## Open a pull request

If you find a bug or want a new feature and you're comfortable making the changes yourself, please fork this repo, make the changes, and open a pull request. There's a good chance that your PR will be merged, but I may make some suggestions first.

If it's going to be a large amount of work, it might be best to open an issue first and discuss the changes before you do all the work, just in case it's something I wouldn't find suitable for Paginatify.

## Fork It

If you tried the above methods and, for whatever reason, I decided not to include your changes or suggestions, please feel free to fork the project and take it in your own direction. I won't be offended. That's how open source software is supposed to work, after all. I only ask that if you intend for your fork to be widely adopted that you change the name to something distinct from Paginatify.
